pregMatchAll.js
===============

Want to use PHP's preg_match_all() in Javascript ? that's what you need.


##TODO
  * I need better tests (especially with the offset parameter)
  * encoding problems (see test #0)
  * Don't know how to deal with empty `matches` with PREG_PATTERN_ORDER et PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE...
  * No support for flag combination yet ...
